  <p class="drop-capi"><span class="gesperrt1">THE</span> <i>Commons</i> in
this present Parliament assembled, having with much earnestnesse,
and faithfulnesse of affection, and zeal to the publike good of this
Kingdom, and His Majesties honour and service for the space of twelve
moneths, wrastled with the great dangers and fears, the pressing
miseries and calamities, the various distempers and disorders, which
had not only assaulted, but even overwhelmed and extinguisht the
liberty, peace, and prosperity of this Kingdom, the comfort and hopes
of all His Majesties good Subjects, and exceedingly weakned and
undermined the foundation and strength of his<span class="pagenum">
<a id="Page_4"></a>p. 4</span> own royall Throne; do yet finde an
abounding malignity, and opposition in those parties and factions,
who have been the cause of those evills, and do still labour to
cast aspersions, upon that which hath been done, and to raise many
difficulties for the hinderance of that which remaines yet undone,
and to foment Jealousies betwixt the King and the Parliament; that so
they may deprive him and his people of the fruit of his own gracious
intentions, and their humble desires of procuring the publike peace,
safety, and happinesse of this Realm. For the preventing of those
miserable effects which such malicious endeavors may produce, We have
thought good to declare,</p>
</div>

<p class="sp1">1. <i>The root, and the growth of these mischievous
designes.</i></p>

<p class="sp1">2. <i>The Maturity and ripenesse, to which they
have attained before the beginning of the Parliament.</i></p>

<p class="sp1">3. <i>The effectuall means which have been used
for the exterpations of those dangerous evils, and
the Progresse which hath therein been made by His
Majesties goodnesse, and the wisedome of the
Parliament.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>p. 5</span></p>

<p class="sp1">4. <i>The wayes of obstruction and opposition, by
which that Progresse hath been interrupted.</i></p>

<p class="sp1">5. <i>The courses to be taken for the removing
those obstacles, and for the accomplishing of our
most dutifull and faithfull intentions, and endeavors,
of restoring and establishing the ancient
Honour, Greatnesse, and Security of this Crown
and Nation. The root of all this mischief We
finde to be a malignant and pernitious designe of
subverting the Fundamentall Lawes, and principles
of Government; upon which the Religion,
and Justice of this Kingdom are firmly establisht.
The Actors and Promoters hereof have
been,</i></p>

<p class="sp2">1. <i>The Jesuited Papists who hate the Laws,
as the Obstacles of that change and Subversion of
Religion, which they so much long for.</i></p>

<p class="sp1">2. <i>The Bishops, and the corrupt part of the
Clergie, who cherish formality and superstition,
as the naturall effects, and more probable supports
of their own Ecclesiasticall Tyranny, and
Usurpation.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>p. 6</span></p>

<p class="sp1">3. <i>Such Councellors and Courtiers, as for
private ends have engaged themselves to further
the intrests of some forraign Princes or States,
to the prejudice of His Majesty, and the state at
home.</i></p>

<p class="sp1">The common Principles by which they
moulded and governed all their particular
Councells and actions were these.</p>

<p class="sp1"><i>First, To maintain continuall differences and
discontents betwixt the King and the People, upon
questions and Prerogative, and liberty, that so they
might have the advantage of sideing with him,
and under the Notions of Men addicted to his service,
gain to themselves and their parties, the
places of greatest trust and power in the Kingdom.</i></p>

<p class="sp1"><i>A Second, To suppresse the purity and power of
Religion, and such persons as were best affected
to it; as being contrary to their own ends, and the
greatest impediment to that change, which they
thought to introduce.</i></p>

<p class="sp1"><i>A Third, To conjoyn those parties of the Kingdom,
which were most propitious to their own
ends,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>p. 7</span>
and to divide those who were most opposite, which
consisted in many particular observations to cherish
the Arminian part in those points, wherein
they agree with the Papists, to multiply and enlarge
the differences betwixt the common Protestants,
and those whom they call Puritans, to
introduce and countenance such opinions and Ceremonies
as are fittest for accommodation with Popery,
to encrease and maintain ignorance, loosenesse,
and prophanenesse in the people: That of those
three parties, Papists, Arminians and Libertines,
they might compose a body fit to act such Counsells
and resolutions, as were most conducible to their
own ends.</i></p>

<p class="sp1"><i>A Fourth, To disaffect the King to Parliaments
by slanders and false imputations, and by
putting him upon other wayes of supply, which in
shew and appearance were fuller of advantage,
then the ordinary course of Subsidies, though in
truth they brought more losse then gain, both to
the King and people, and have caused the great
distractions, under which we both suffer.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="sp2 drop-capn"><span class="sc">AS</span> in all compounded bodies,
the Operations are qualified according to the predominant
Element; So in this mixt party,
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>p. 8</span>
Jesuited Councells being most active, and
prevailing, may easily be discovered to have
had the greatest sway in all their determinations,
and if they be not prevented, are likely
to devour the rest, or to turn them into their
own nature.</p>

<p>In the beginning of His Majesties raign, the
partie begun to revive and flourish again, having
been somewhat dampt by the breach
with <i>Spain</i> in the last yeer of King <i>James</i>, and
by His Majesties marriage with <i>France</i>;
the interests and Councells of that State, being
not so contrary to the good of Religion, and
the prosperity of this Kingdom, as those of
<i>Spain</i>, and the Papists of <i>England</i> having been
ever more addicted to <i>Spain</i>, then <i>France</i>;
Yet they still retained a purpose, and resolution
to weaken the Protestant parties in all parts,
and even in <i>France</i>, whereby to make way
for the change of Religion, which they intended
at home.</p>

<p>The first effect and evidence of their recovery
and strength was, the dissolution of the
Parliament at <i>Oxford</i>, after there had been
given two Subsidies to His Majestie; and before
they received relief in any one Grievance,
many other more miserable effects
followed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>p. 9</span>
The losse of the <i>Rochel</i> Fleet, by the help of
our Shipping set forth and delivered over to
the <i>French</i>, in opposition to the advice of Parliament,
which left that Town without defence
by Sea, and made way not only to the
losse of that important place, but likewise
to the losse of all the strength and security of
the Protestant Religion in <i>France</i>. The diverting
of His Majesties course of warres from
the West-<i>Indies</i>, which was the most facile
and hopefull way for this Kingdom to prevail
against the Spaniard, to an expensefull
and successelesse attempt upon <i>Cales</i>, which
was so ordered, as if it had rather been intended
to make us weary of Warre, then to
prosper in it. The precipitate breach which
<i>France</i> by taking their Ships to a great value,
without making recompence to the <i>English</i>,
whose goods were thereupon imbarâ€™d, and
confiscate in that Kingdom. The peace with
<i>Spain</i> without consent of Parliament, contrary
to the promise of King <i>James</i>, to both
Houses; whereby the <i>Palatine</i> cause was diserted
and left to chargeable, and hopelesse
Treaties, which for the most part were managed
by those who might justly be suspected
to be no friends to that cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>p. 10</span></p>

<p>The charging of the Kingdom with Billetted
Souldiers in all parts of it, and that Concomitant
designe of <i>Germane</i> horse, that
the Land might either submit with fear, or
be enforced with rigour to such Arbitrary
Contributions, as should be required of them.
The dissolving of the Parliament in the second
yeer of His Majesties raign, after a Declaration
of their intent, to grant five Subsidies.</p>

<p>The exacting of the like proportion of five
Subsidies after the Parliament dissolved, by
Commission of Loan; and divers Gentlemen
and others imprisoned for not yeilding to pay
that Loan, whereby many of them contracted
such sicknesses, as cost them their lives. Great
summes of Money required and raised by Privy
Seals. An unjust and pernicious attempt to
extort great payments from the subject, by
way of <i>Excise</i>; and a Commission issued under
Seal to that purpose. The Petition of
Right, which was granted in full Parliament,
blasted with an illegall Declaration, to make
it destructive to it self, to the power of Parliament,
to the Liberty of the Subject, and to
that purpose printed with it; and the Petition
made of no use, but to shew the bold and
presumptuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>p. 11</span>
injustice of such Ministers as durst
break the Laws, and suppresse the Liberties of
the Kingdom, after they had been so solemnly
and evidently declared.</p>

<p>Another Parliament dissolved, 4 <i>Car.</i> the
priviledge of Parliament broken, by imprisoning
divers Members of the House, detaining
them close prisoners for many months together,
without the liberty of using Books,
Pen, Inke, or Paper, denying them all the comforts
of life, all means of preservation of
health, not permitting their wives to come unto
them, even in time of their sicknesse. And
for the compleating of that cruelty, after yeers
spent in such miserable durance, depriving
them of the necessary means of Spirituall consolation,
not suffering them to go abroad to
enjoy Gods Ordinances, in Gods House, or
Gods Ministers to come to them, to administer
comfort unto them in their private Chambers:
and to keep them still in this oppressed condition,
not admitting them to be Bayled according
to Law, yet vexing them with Informations
in inferiour Courts, sentencing and fining
some of them for matters done in Parliament,
and extorting the payments of those Fines
from them, enforcing others to put in
security<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>p. 12</span>
of good behaviour, before they could be
released.</p>

<p>The imprisonment of the rest which refused
to be bound, still continued; which
might have been perpetuall, if necessity had
not, the last yeer, brought another Parliament
to relieve them; of whom, one died, by the
cruelty and harshnesse of his imprisonment,
which would admit of no relaxation, notwithstanding
the imminent danger of his life,
did sufficiently appear by the declaration of
his Physitian: And his release, or at least, his refreshment,
was sought by many humble Petitions.
And his blood still cries either for vengeance,
or repentance of those Ministers of State,
who at once obstructed the course, both of his
Majesties Justice and Mercy.</p>

<p>Upon the dissolution of both these Parliaments,
untrue and scandalous declarations
published, to asperse their proceedings, and
some of their Members, unjustly to make them
odious, and colour the violence which was
used against them. Proclamations set out to
the same purpose; and to the great dejecting
of the hearts of the people, forbidding them,
even to speak of Parliaments.</p>

<p>After the breach of the Parliament, in
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>p. 13</span>
fourth yeer of his Majesty, Injustice, Oppression,
and Violence, broke in upon us, without any
restraint or moderation; &amp; yet the first project,
was the great sums exacted thorow the
whole Kingdom, for default of Knight-hood,
which seemed to have some colour and shadow
of a Law; yet if it be rightly examined by
that obsolete Law which was pretended for
it, it would be found to be against all the rules
of Justice, both in respect of the persons charged,
the proportion of the Fines demanded,
and the absurd and unreasonable manner of
their proceedings.</p>

<p>Tonnage and Poundage hath been received
without colour or pretence of Law: Many
other heavy impositions continued against
Law; and some so unreasonable, that the
summe of the charge, exceeds the value of
the Goods. The Book of Rates lately inhansed
to a high proportion; and such Merchants
as would not submit to their illegall and unreasonable
payments, were vexed and oppressed
above measure; and the ordinary course of
Justice, the common Birth-right of the subject
of <i>England</i>, wholly obstructed unto them. And
although all this was taken upon pretence of
guarding the Sea, yet a new and unheard
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>p. 14</span>
Tax of Ship-money was devised, upon the
same pretence. By both which, there was
charged upon the subject neer 700000 l. some
yeers; and yet the Merchants have been left so
naked to the violence of the Turkish Pyrats,
that many great Ships of value, and thousands
of his Majesties subjects have been taken by
them, and do still remain in miserable slavery.</p>

<p>The enlargement of Forrests, contrary to
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Charta de Foresta</i></span>, and
the composition thereupon.
The exactions of Coat and Conduct-money,
and divers other Military charges. The
taking away the Arms of the Trayned Bands
of divers Counties. The desperate design of
engrossing all the Gun-powder into one hand,
keeping it in the Tower of <i>London</i>, and setting
so high a Rate upon it, that the poorer sort
were not able to buy it, nor could any have
it without License; thereby to leave the severall
parts of the Kingdom destitute of their necessary
defense; and by selling so dear that
which was sold, to make an unlawfull advantage
of it, to the great charge and detriment
of the subject, the generall destruction
of the Kings Timber, especially
that in the Forrest of <i>Dean</i>, sold to
Papists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>p. 15</span>
which was the best Store-house of this Kingdom,
for the maintenance of our Shipping.
The taking away of mens right, under colour
of the Kings title to Land between high and
low water-Marks. The Monopolies of Sope,
Salt, Wine, Leather, Sea-Cole, and, in a manner,
of all things of most common and necessary
use. The restraint of the Liberties of the
subjects in their habitation, Trades, and other
Interests. Their vexation and oppression
by Purveyors, Clerks of the Market, and
Salt-Peeter-men. The sale of pretended Nuzances,
as Buildings in and about <i>London</i>, conversion
of Arrable into Pasture; continuance
of Pasture, under the name of depopulation,
Have drawn many Millions out of the subjects
Purses, without any considerable profit
to his Majesty. Large quantities of Common,
and severall Grounds, have been taken from
the subject, by colour of the Statute of Improvement,
and by abuse of the Commission
of Sewers, without their consent, and against
it. And not onely private Interest, but also publike
faith have been broken, in seizing of the
money and Bullion in the Mint; and the
whole Kingdom like to be robbâ€™d at once, in
that abominable project of Brasse
Money.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>p. 16</span>
Great numbers of his Majesties subjects, for
refusing those unlawfull charges, have been
vext with long and expensive suits; some fined
and censured, others committed to long
and hard imprisonments and confinements,
to the losse of health of many, of life in some;
and others have had their houses broken up,
their goods seized; some have been restrained
from their lawfull Callings: Ships have been
interrupted in their Voyages; surprized at Sea
in an Hostile manner, by Projectors, as by a
common Enemy: Merchants prohibited to
unlade their Goods in such Ports, as were for
their own advantage, and forced to bring
them to those places which were most for the
advantages of the Monopolizers and Projectors.</p>

<p>The Court of Starchamber hath abounded
in extravagant Censures, not only for the
maintenance and improvement of Monopolies,
and other unlawfull taxes; but for divers
other Causes, where there hath been no
offence, or very small; whereby His Majesties
Subjects have been oppressed by grievous
Fines, Imprisonments, Stigmatizings, Mutilations,
Whippings, Pillories, Gags, Confinements,
Banishments; after so rigid
a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>p. 17</span>
manner, as hath not only deprived Men of
the Society of their Friends, exercise of their
Professions, comfort of Books, use of Paper
or Inke, but even violated that neer Union
which God hath establisht betwixt Men
and their Wives, by forced and constrained
seperation; whereby they have been bereaved
of the comfort and conversation one of another,
for many yeers together, without hope
of relief; if God had not by his over-ruling
Providence, given some interruption to the
prevailing power and Councell of those, who
were the Authors and Promoters of such
peremptory and headdy courses.</p>

<p>Judges have been put out of their places,
for refusing to do against their Oathes, and
Consciences: Others have been so awed, that
they durst not do their duties, and the better
to hold a rod over them, the Clause <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quam diu
se bene gesserit</i></span> was left out of their Patents, and a new
Clause <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Durante bene placito</i></span> inserted.
Lawyers have been checkt, for being
faithfull to their Clients; Sollicitors, and Atturneyes
have been threatned, and some punished
for following lawfull Suites: And by
this means all the approaches to Justice
were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>p. 18</span>
interrupted and forecluded. New Oaths have
been forced upon the Subject against Law;
new Judicatories erected without Law: The
Councell Table have, by their Orders, offered
to binde the Subjects in their free-holds Estates,
Suites, and Actions. The pretended
Court of the Earl <i>Marshal</i> was Arbitrary, and
Illegall in its being, and proceedings. The
Chancery, Exchequer-Chamber, Court of
Wards, and other <i>English</i> Courts have been
grievous in exceeding their Jurisdiction. The
estate of many Families weakned, and some
ruined by excessive Fines, exacted from them
for Compositions of Wardships. All Leases
of above a hundred yeers, made to draw on
Wardship contrary to Law. Undue proceedings
used in the finding of Offices, to make
the Jury finde for the King. The Common-Law
Courts, seeing all Men more inclined to
seek Justice there, where it may be fitted to
their own desire, are known frequently to
forsake the Rules of the Common-Law, and
straining beyond their bounds, under pretence
of equity to do Injustice. Titles of Honour,
Judiciall places, Serjeantships at Law,
and other Offices have been sold for
great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>p. 19</span>
summes of Money; whereby the common
Justice of the Kingdom hath been much endangered,
not only by opening away of employment
in places of great Trust, and advantage
to Men of weak parts; but also by giving
occasion to Bribery, Extortion, Partiality;
It seldome hapning that places ill-gotten
are well used. Commissions have been granted
for examining the excesse of Fees: and
when great exactions have been discovered,
Compositions have been made with Delinquents,
not only for the time past, but likewise
for immunity and security in offending,
for the time to come; which under colour of
remedy, hath but confirmed, and encreased
the Grievance to the Subject.</p>

<p class="sp1">The usuall course of pricking Sheriffs, not
observed, but many times Sheriffs made in
an extraordinary way; sometimes as a punishment
and charge unto them; sometimes such
were pricked out, as would be Instruments
to execute whatsoever they would have to be
done.</p>

<p class="sp1">The Bishops and the rest of the Clergy,
did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>p. 20</span>
triumph in the Suspensions, Excommunications,
Deprivations, and Degradations of divers
painfull, learned, and pious Ministers, in
the vexation, and grievous oppression of great
numbers of His Majesties good Subjects.
The High-Commission grew to such excesse
of sharpnesse and severity, as was not much
lesse then the Romish Inquisition; and yet in
many cases by the Archbishops power, was
made much more heavy, being assisted, and
strengthened by authority of the Councell-Table.</p>

<p class="sp1">The Bishops, and their Courts, were as
eager in the Countrey; and although their
jurisdiction could not reach so high in rigour,
and extremity of punishment, yet were they
no lesse grievous, in respect of the generallity,
and multiplicity of vexations, which lighting
upon the meaner sort of Tradesmen, and
Artificers, did impoverish many thousands,
and so afflict and trouble others, that great
numbers, to avoid their miseries, departed out
of the Kingdom, some into <i>New-England</i>,
and other parts of <i>America</i>, others into <i>Holland</i>,
where they have transported their
Manufactures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>p. 21</span>
of Cloath which is not only a losse
by diminishing the present stock of the Kingdome,
but a great mischiefe by impairing
and endangering the losse of that peculiar
Trade of Cloathing, which hath been a plentifull
Fountain of Wealth and Honour to this
Nation.</p>

<p class="sp1">Those were fittest for Ecclesiasticall preferment,
and soonest obtained it, who were
most officious in promoting superstition, most
virulent in railing against Godlinesse, and
honesty.</p>

<p class="sp1">The most publike and solemn Sermons before
His Majestie were, either to advance
Prerogative above Law, and Decry the propertie
of the Subject, or full of such kinde of
invectives; whereby they might make those
odious, who sought to maintain the Religion,
Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom; and
such Men were sure to be weeded out of the
Commission of the peace, and out of all
other imployments of power in the Government
of the Countrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>p. 22</span></p>

<p class="sp1">Many noble Personages were Councellors
in name; but the power and authority remained
in a few of such, as were most addicted
to this partie; whose resolutions, and
determinations were brought to the Table,
for countenance, and execution, and not for
debate, and deliberation; and no Man could
offer to appose them without disgrace, and
hazard to himself: Nay, all those that did not
wholly concurre and actively contribute to
the furtherance of their designes, though otherwise,
persons of never so great Honour,
and Abilities, were so farre from being employed
in any place of Trust, and power, that
they were neglected, discountenanced, and
upon all occasions injured and oppressed.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="sp1">This Faction was grown to that height,
and entirenesse of power, that now they began
to think of finishing their Work, which
consisted of these three parts.</p>

<div class="fs125 sp1">
<p class="sp1 nf-center">1.</p>

<p><i>The Government must be set

It was thought necessary to
reduce <span class="special" title="strong">Scotland</span>
to such Popish superstitions, and
Innovations, as might make them apt
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>p. 24</span>

that great change which was intended. Whereupon new
Canons, and a new Liturgy were prest
upon them; and when they refused to admit
of them, an Army was raised to
force them to it, towards which the
Clergie, and the Papists were very forward
in their contribution. The Scots
likewise raised an Army for their defence;
and when both Armies were
come together, and ready for a bloudy
encounter, His Majesties own Gracious
disposition, and the Councell of the English
Nobility, and Dutifull submission
of the Scots, did so farre prevail against
the evil Councell of others, that a Pacification
was made, and His Maiesty
returned with Peace, and much Honour
to <span class="special" title="strong">London</span>.</i></p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>p. 25</span></p>

<p class="sp1">The unexpected reconciliation was most
acceptable to all the Kingdome, except to
the malignant partie, whereof the Archbishop
and the Earle of Strafford being heads,
they and their faction begun to enveigh
against the Peace, and to aggravate the proceeding
of the States, which so incensed
His Majestie, that he forthwith prepared
again for Warre. And such was their confidence,
that having corrupted and distempered
the whole frame and Government of
the Kingdome, they did now hope to corrupt
that which was the onely means to restore
all to a right frame and Temper again:
to which end they perswaded His Majestie
to call a Parliament, not to seek Counsell
and advice of them, but to draw Countenance
and Supply from them, and engage
the whole Kingdome in their Quarrell: and
in the mean time continued all their unjust
Levies of Money, resolving either to make
the Parliament pliant to their Will, and to
establish mischief by a Law, or else to break
it; and with more colour to go on by violence,
to take what they could not obtain
by consent. The ground alledged for
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>p. 26</span>
justification of this Warre was this.</p>

<p>That the undutifull Demands of the Parliaments
of <i>Scotland</i>, was a sufficient reason
for His Maiestie to take Armes against them
without hearing the Reason of those Demands,
And thereupon a new Armie was
prepared against them, their Ships were seized
in all Ports, both of <i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>,
and at Sea. Their Petitions reiected; their
Commissioners refused Audience. This
whole Kingdome most miserably distempered
with Levies of Men and Money, and
Imprisonments of those who denied to submit
to those Levies. The Earle of <i>Strafford</i>
past into <i>Ireland</i>, caused the <i>Parliament</i> there
to declare against the <i>Scots</i>, to give foure
Subsidies towards that War; and to ingage
themselves, their lives and fortunes for the
prosecution of it, and gave directions for an
Armie of eight thousand foot, and one thousand
horse to be levied there, which were
for the most part Papists. The <i>Parliament</i>
met upon the thirteenth of <i>April</i>, one thousand
six hundred and fourtie. The Earle of
<i>Strafford</i> and Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i> with
their Partie so prevailed with His
Maiestie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>p. 27</span>
that the <i>House of Commons</i> was prest to yeeld
to a Supply for maintenance of the Warre
with <i>Scotland</i>, before they had provided any
reliefe for the great and pressing Grievances
of the people, which being against the fundamentall
Priviledge and proceeding of
<i>Parliament</i>, was yet in humble respect to his
Maiestie, so far admitted, as that they agreed
to take the matter of Supply into consideration,
and two severall dayes it was debated.
Twelve Subsidies were demanded for
the release of Ship-money alone; A third
day was appointed for Conclusion when
the Heads of that Partie begun to fear the
people might close with the King in satisfying
his desire of Money: But that withall
they were like to blast their malicious designes
against <i>Scotland</i>, finding them verie
much indisposed to give any countenance to
that Warre.</p>

<p class="sp1">Thereupon they wickedly advised the
King to break off the <i>Parliament</i>, and to return
to the wayes of Confusion, in which
their own evill intentions were most like to
prosper and succeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>p. 28</span></p>

<p class="sp1">After the <i>Parliament</i> ended the fifth of
<i>May</i>, one thousand six hundred and fourty,
this Partie grew so bold, as to counsell the
King to supply Himself out of his Subiects
states by his own power, at his own Will,
without their consent. The very next day
some <i>Members of both Houses</i> had their Studies
and Cabinets, yea their Pockets searched:
Another of them not long after was committed
close prisoner for not delivering some
Petitions which he received by authoritie
of that <i>House</i>, and if harsher courses were
intended (as was reported) it is very probable
that the sicknesse of the Earl of <i>Strafford</i>
and the Tumultuous rising in <i>Southwarke</i>,
and about <i>Lambeth</i>, were the causes that
such violent intentions were not brought to
execution. A false and scandalous Declaration
against the <i>House of Commons</i> was published,
in his Maiesties Name, which yet
wrought little effect with the people, but
onely to manifest the impudence of those
who were Authors of it.</p>

<p class="sp1">A forced Loan of Money was attempted in the Citie of
<i>London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>p. 29</span></i>.</p>

<p class="sp1">The Lord Major and Aldermen in their
severall Wards enioyned to bring in a list of
the Names of such persons as they iudged fit
to lend, and of the summe they should lend.
And such Aldermen as refused so to do were
committed to prison.</p>

<p class="sp1">The <i>Archbishop</i> and the other <i>Bishops</i> and
<i>Clergie</i> continued the <i>Convocation</i>, and by a
new Commission turned it to a <i>Provinciall
Synod</i>, in which by an unheard of presumption,
they made <i>Canons</i> that contain in them
many matters contrarie to the Kings Prerogative,
to the fundamentall Laws and
Statutes of the Realm, to the right of <i>Parliaments</i>,
to the Propertie and Libertie of the
Subiect, and matters tending to sedition and
of dangerous consequence, thereby establishing
their own Vsurpations, justifying
their Altar-worship, and those other superstitious
Innovations which they formerly
introduced, without warrant of Law.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="sp1">They imposed a new Oath upon divers
of his Maiesties Subiects, both <i>Ecclesiasticall</i>
and <i>Lay</i>, for maintenance of their own
Tyrannie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>p. 30</span>
and laid a great Tax upon the Clergy
for supply of his Maiestie; and generally they
shewed themselves very affectionate to the
Warre with <i>Scotland</i>, which was by some
of them stiled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Bellum Episcopale</i></span>,
and a prayer composed, and enioyned to be read in all
Churches, calling the <i>Scots</i>, <i>Rebels</i>, to put
the two Nations into blood, and make them
irreconciliable. All those pretended <i>Canons</i>
and <i>Constitutions</i> were armed with the severall
Censures of <i>Suspension</i>, <i>Excommunication</i>,
<i>Deprivation</i>, by which they would have
thrust out all the good Ministers, and most
of the well affected people of the Kingdome,
and left an easie passage to their own
Designe of Reconciliation with <i>Rome</i>.
The <i>Popish</i> party enioyned such Exemptions
from the <i>Penall Laws</i> as amounted to a Tolleration,
besides many other encouragements,
and Court favours: They had a Secretarie
of State, S<sup>ir</sup>. <i>Francis Windibank</i>, a
powerfull Agent for the speeding of all their
desires, a <i>Popes Nuntio</i> residing here to act
and govern them according to such influences
as he received from <i>Rome</i>, and to intercede
for them with the most powerfull
concurrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>p. 31</span>
of the forraigne Princes of that religion:
By his authoritie the <i>Papists</i> of all
sorts, Nobility, Gentry, and Clergie were
convocated, after the manner of a <i>Parliament</i>,
new Iurisdictions were erected of <i>Romish
Archbishops</i>, Taxes levied, another State
moulded within this State independant in
Government, contrary in interest and affection,
secretly corrupting the Ignorant, or
negligent professors of our Religion, and
closely uniting and combining themselves
against such as were sound, in this posture
waiting for an opportunitie by force to destroy
those whom they could not hope to
seduce. For the effecting whereof, they were
strengthened with Armes and Munition, encouraged
by superstitious Prayers enioyned
by the <i>Nuntio</i> to be weekly made for the
prosperitie of some great designe. And such
power had they at Court, that secretly a
Commission was issued out, intended to be
issued to some great Men of that profession
for the levying of Souldiers, and to command
and employ them according to private
Instructions, which we doubt were
framed for the advantage of those who
were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>p. 32</span>
the contrivers of them: His Maiesties Treasure
was consumed, his Revenew anticipated,
His Servants and Officers compelled to
lend great summes of Money; Multitudes
were called to the <i>Councell Table</i>, who were
tired with long attendances there, for refusing
illegall payments. The <i>Prisons</i> were filled
with their Commitments; many of the
Sheriffes summoned into the <i>Starre Chamber</i>,
and some imprisoned for not being quicke
enough in levying the Ship-money, the
people languished under grief, and fear, no
visible hope being left, but in desperation.
The Nobility began to be wearie of their
silence, and patience, and sensible of the
dutie and Trust which belongs to them: and
thereupon some of the most eminent of
them did petition His Maiesty at such a time
when evil Councels were so strong that they
had reason to expect more hazard to themselves,
then redresse of those publike evils
for which they interceded, whilest the Kingdome
was in this Agitation and distemper,
the <i>Scots</i> restrained in their Trades, impoverished
by the losse of many of their Ships,
bereaved of all possibility of satisfying
His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>p. 33</span>
Majestie by any naked Supplication, entred
with a powerfull Army into the Kingdome,
and without any hostile Act or
spoil in the Countrey as they passed, more
then forcing a passage over the <i>Tyne</i> at
<i>Newborne</i>, neer <i>Newcastle</i>, possessed themselves
of <i>Newcastle</i>, and had a fair opportunitie
to presse on further upon the Kings
Armie: but dutie and Reverence to his Majestie,
and brotherly love to the <i>English</i> Nation,
made them stay there, whereby the
King had leasure to entertain better Councels,
wherein God so blessed and directed
him, that he summoned the great Councell
of Peers to meet at <i>Yorke</i>, upon the twentie
fourth of September, and there declared a
Parliament to begin the third of Novemb.
then following. The Scots the first day of
the great Councell, presented an humble
Petition to His Majestie, whereupon the
Treatie was appointed at Rippon. A present
Cessation of armes agreed upon: and
the full Conclusion of all differences referred
to the wisedome and care of the Parliament.
At our first meeting all Oppositions
seemed to vanish, the mischieves were
so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>p. 34</span>
evident, which those evil Councellors produced,
that no Man durst stand up to defend
them. Yet the work it self afforded difficultie
enough. The multiplied evils and
corruption of sixteen yeers strengthened by
custome and authoritie, and the concurrent
interest of many powerfull delinquents
were now to be brought to iudgement and
Reformation. The Kings Houshold was to
be provided for, they had brought him to
that want, that he could not supply His
Ordinarie, and necessarie expences, without
the assistance of his people. Two Armies
were to be paied, which amounted very neer
to 80. thousand pounds a moneth; the
people were to be tenderly charged, having
been formerly exhausted with many burthensome
Proiects. The difficulties seemed
to be insuperable, which by the Divine Providence
we have overcome. The Contrarieties
incompatible, which yet in a great measure
we have reconciled. Six Subsidies have
been granted, and a Bill of Poll-money,
which if it be duely levied, may equall six
Subsidies more in all: Six hundred thousand
pounds. Besides we have contracted a
Debt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>p. 35</span>
to the Scots of 220. thousand pounds; and
yet God hath so blessed the endeavours of
this Parliament, that the Kingdom is a great
gainer by all these charges. The Ship-money
is abolished, which cost the Kingdome
above 200. thousand pounds a yeer. The
Coat and Conduct money, and other militarie
charges, are taken away, which in many
Countreys amounted to little lesse then
the Ship-money. The Monopolies are all
supprest, whereof some few did preiudice
the Subiect, above a Million yearly. The
Soape an hundred thousand pounds; the
Wine three hundred thousand pounds; the
Leather must needs exceed both: and Salt
could be no lesse then that, besides the inferiour
Monopolies, which if they could be
exactly computed, would make up a great
summe. That which is more beneficiall
then all this is, that the root of these evils is
taken away, which was the arbitrarie power
pretended to be in his Maiestie, of taxing
the Subiect, or charging their estates without
consent in Parliament, which is now
declared to be against Law by the iudgement
of both Houses, and likewise by
an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>p. 36</span>
Act of Parliament. Another step of great
advantage is this: the living Grievances, the
evil Councellors and actors of these mischiefs
have been so quelled, by the justice
done upon the Earl of Strafford, the flight
of the Lord <i>Finch</i>, and Secretarie <i>Windibank</i>.
The accusation and imprisonment of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, of Iudge
<i>Bartlet</i>, and the impeachment of divers other
Bishops and Iudges, that it is like not
onely to be an ease to the present times, but
a preservation to the future. The discontinuance
of Parliaments is prevented by the
Bill for a Trienniall Parliament, and the
abrupt dissolution of this Parliament by another
Bill; by which it is provided it shall
not be dissolved or adiourned without the
consent of both Houses. Which two Laws
well considered, may be thought more advantagious
then all the former, because they
secure a full operation of the present remedie,
and afford a perpetuall Spring of remedies
for the future: The Star-Chamber,
the High Commission, the Courts of the
President, and Councell in the North,
were so many forges of miserie,
oppression,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>p. 37</span>
and violence, and are all taken away, whereby
men are more secured in their persons,
liberties, and estates, then they could be by
any Law or Example for the regulation of
those Courts, or Terror of the Iudges; The
immoderate power of the <i>Councell Table</i>, and
the excessive abuse of that power is so ordered
and restrained, that we may well hope
that no such things as were frequently done
by them, to the prejudice of the publique libertie,
will appear in future times but onely
in Stories, to give us and our posteritie
more occasion to praise God for His Maiesties
goodnesse, and the faithfull endeavours
of this <i>Parliament</i>. The <i>Canons</i>, and the
power of <i>Canon</i> making, are blasted by the
Vote of both <i>Houses</i>. The exorbitant power
of <i>Bishops</i>, and their Courts, are much abated,
by some Provisions in the Bill against
the <i>High Commission Court</i>. The authors of the
many innovations in Doctrine and Ceremonies;
The Ministers that have been scandalous
in their lives, have been so terrified in
iust complaints and accusations, that we
may well hope they will be more
modest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>p. 38</span>
for the time to come; either inwardly convicted
by the sight of their own folly, or
outwardly restrained by the fear of punishment.
The <i>Forrests</i> are by a good Law reduced
to their right bounds; The encroachments
and oppressions of the <i>Stannarie
Courts</i>; The Extortions of the Clerk of the
Market, and the Compulsion of the Subiect
to receive the Order of Knighthood against
his will, paying of Fines for not receiving it,
and the vexatious proceedings thereupon
for levying of those Fines, are by other beneficiall
Laws reformed and prevented.
Many excellent Laws and provisions are in
preparation for removing the inordinate
power, vexation, and usurpation of <i>Bishops</i>,
for reforming the pride and Idlenesse of
many of the Clergie, for easing the people
of unnecessarie Ceremonies in Religion, for
censuring and removing unworthy and unprofitable
Ministers; and for maintaining
godly and diligent Preachers through the
Kingdome: Other things of many importance
for the good of this Kingdome, are in
proposition, though little could hitherto
be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>p. 39</span>
done, in regard of the many other more
pressing businesses, which yet before the
end of this Session, we hope may receive
some progresse and perfection. The establishing
and ordering the Kings Revenue,
that so the abuse of Officers, and superfluity
of expences may be cut off, and the necessarie
disbursments for his Majesties Honor,
the defence and government of the Kingdome,
may be more certainly provided for.
The regulating of Courts of Iustice, and
abridging both the delayes and charges of
Law Suits; The setling of some good
courses for preventing the exportation of
Gold and Silver, and the inequality of exchanges
betwixt us and other Nations,
for the advancing of native Commodities,
increase of our Manufactures, and well
ballancing of Trade, whereby the Stock of
the Kingdome may be increased, or at least
kept from impairing, as through neglect
hereof it hath done for many yeers last past;
For improving the Herring fishing, upon
our own Coasts, which will be of mightie
use in the imployment of the poore, and
a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>p. 40</span>
plentifull Nurserie of Mariners for inabling
the Kingdome in any great Action. The
oppositions, obstructions; and other Difficulties
wherewith we have been encountred,
and which still lye in our way with
some strength and much obstinacie are
these: The malignant Partie whom we
have formerly described, to be the Actors
and promoters of all our miserie, they have
taken heart again; They have been able to
preferre some of their own Factors and
Agents to degrees of honour, to places of
Trust and imployment even during the
<i>Parliament</i>. They have endeavoured to
work in His Maiestie ill impressions and opinions
of Our proceedings, as if we had altogether
done our own work, and not His,
and had obtained from him many things
very preiudiciall to the Crown, both in respect
of Prerogative and Profit. To wipe
out this slander, We think good onely to say
thus much: That all that We have done, is
for His Maiestie, His greatnesse, Honor, and
support, when We yeelded to give 25000. l.
a moneth for the relief of the Northerne
Countreys,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>p. 41</span>
this was given to the King, for he was bound to
protect his subiects, they were his Maiesties evill
Counsellors, and their ill instruments that were
actors in those grievances which brought in the
Scots: and if his Majesty please to force those
who were the authors of this warre to make satisfaction,
as he might justly and easily doe, it
seemes very reasonable that the people might
well be excused from taking upon them this
burthen, being altogether innocent, and free from
being any causes of it.</p>

<p>When we undertooke the charge of the army,
which cost above 50000. pound a moneth, was
not this given to the King? was it not his Majesties
army? were not all the Commanders under
contract with his Majesty at higher rates and
greater wages then ordinary? and have not we
taken upon us to discharge all the brotherly
assistance of three hundred thousand pounds
which we gave the Scots? was it not toward repaire
of those dammages and losses which they
received from the Kings ships, and from his ministers?
These three particulars amount to above
1100. thousand pound, besides his Majesty hath
received by impositions upon merchandise at
least 400. thousand pounds; so that his
Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>p. 42</span>
hath had out of the subjects purse since the Parliament
began, one million and halfe, and yet
these men can be so impudent, as to tell his Majesty,
that we have done nothing for him. As to
the second branch of this slander, we acknowledge
with much thankfulnesse that his Majesty
hath passed more good Bils to the advantage of
the subjects then hath been in many ages; but
withall we cannot forget, that these venomous
counsels did manifest themselves in some endeavours
to hinder these good Acts: And for both
Houses of Parliament wee may with truth and
modesty say thus much, That we have ever been
carefull not to desire any thing that should weaken
the Crowne either in just profit or usefull
power. The trienniall Parliament, for the matter
of it, doth not extend to so much as by Law we
ought to have required, there being two Statutes
still in force for a Parliament to be once a yeere,
and for the manner of it, it is in the Kings power,
that it shall never take effect, if he by a timely
summons shall prevent any other way of assembling.
In the Bill for continuance of this present
Parliament, there seemes to be some restraint of
the royall power in dissolving of Parliaments,
not to take it out of the Crowne, but to
suspend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>p. 43</span>
the execution of it for this time and occasion
onely, which was so necessary for the Kings
owne security, and the publique peace, that without
it wee could not have undertaken any of
these great charges, but must have left both the
armies to disorder and confusion, and the whole
Kingdome to blood and rapin. The Starchamber
was much more fruitfull in oppression then in
profit, the great fines being for the most part
given away, and the rest stalled at long times.
The fines of the high Commission were in themselves
unjust and seldome or never came into
the Kings purse. These foure Bils are particularly
and more specially instanced, in the rest, there
will not be found so much as a shadow of prejudice
to the Crowne. They have sought to diminish
our reputation with the people, and to
bring them out of love with Parliaments: the
aspersions which they have attempted this way,
have beene such as these, That we have spent
much time and done little, especially in those
grievances which concerne Religion. That the
Parliament is a burden to the Kingdome by the
abundance of Protections which hinder Justice
and Trade, and by many Subsidies granted much
more heavy then any they formerly endured;
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>p. 44</span>
which there is a ready answer: If the time spent
in this Parliament be considered in relation
backward to the long growth and deep roote of
those grievances, which wee have removed, to
the powerfull supports of those delinquents
which wee have pursued, to the great necessities
and other charges of the Common wealth for
which we have provided: or if it be considered
in relation forward to many advantages, which
not onely the present but future ages are like to
reape by the good lawes and other proceedings
in this Parliament, we doubt not but it will be
thought by all indifferent judgments that our
time hath beene much better imployed then in
a farre greater proportion of time in many former
Parliaments put together; and the charges
which have beene laid upon the Subjects, and
the other inconveniences which they have borne
will seeme very light in respect of the benefit
they have and may receive. And for the matter
of Protections, the Parliament is so sensible of
it, that therein they intend to give them whatsoever
ease may stand with Honour and Justice;
and are in a way of passing a Bill to give them
satisfaction. They have sought by many subtile
practices, to cause jealousies and divisions
betwixt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>p. 45</span>
us and our brethren of <i>Scotland</i>, by slandering
their proceedings and intentions towards
us, and by secret endeavours to instigate
and incense them and us one against another.
They have had such a party of Bishops and
popish Lords in the House of Peeres, as hath
caused much opposition and delay in the prosecution
of delinquents, hindred the proceedings
of divers good Bils passed in the Commons
House, concerning the reformation of
sundry great abuses and corruptions both in
Church and State. They have laboured to
seduce and corrupt some of the Commons
House, to draw them into Conspiracies and
Combinations against the libertie of the Parliament:
And by their instruments and agents
they have attempted to disaffect and discontent
his Majesties Army, and to ingage it for
the maintenance of their wicked and trayterous
designes, the keeping up of Bishops in
their Votes and functions, and by force to compell
the Parliament to order, limit, and dispose
their proceedings in such manner as might best
concurre with the intentions of this dangerous
and potent faction: And when one mischievous
designe, and attempt of theirs to bring on
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>p. 46</span>
Army against the Parliament, and the City of
<i>London</i> had been discovered and prevented, they
presently undertooke another of the same damnable
nature, with this addition to it, to endeavour
to make the Scotish Army neutrall, whilst
the English Army which they had laboured to
corrupt and invenome against us by their false
and slanderous suggestions should execute their
malice to the subversion of our Religion and
the dissolution of our government. Thus they
have beene continually practizing to disturbe
the peace, and plotting the destruction even of
all the Kings Dominions, and have employed
their emissaries and agents in them all for the
promoting of their divellish designes which the
vigilancie of those who were well affected hath
still discovered and defeated before they were
ripe for execution in <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>: only
in <i>Ireland</i> which was farther of, they have had
time and opportunity to mould and prepare
their worke, and had brought it to that perfection
that they had possessed themselves of that
whole Kingdome, totally subverted the government
of it, rooted out Religion, and destroyed
all the protestants whom the conscience of their
duty to God, their King and Countrey
would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>p. 47</span>
not have permitted to joyne with them, if by
Gods wonderfull providence their maine enterprize
upon the City and Castell of <i>Dublin</i> had
not beene detected and prevented upon the very
eave before it should have beene executed. Notwithstanding
they have in other parts of that
Kingdome broken out into open rebellion, surprised
Townes and Castles, committed murders,
rapes, and other villanies; and shaken off
all bonds of obedience to his Majesty, and the
lawes of the Realme; and in generall have kindled
such a fire, as nothing but Gods infinite blessing
upon the wisdome and endeavours of this
State will be able to quench it: and certainely
had not God in his great mercy unto this Land
discovered and confounded their former designes,
we had been the Prologue to this Tragedy
in <i>Ireland</i>, and had by this time been made
the lamentable spectacle of misery and confusion.
And now what hope have we but in God,
when as the onely means of our subsistance, and
power of reformation is under him, in the Parliament;
but what can we the Commons without
the conjunction of the House of Lords,
and what conjunction can wee expect there,
when the Bishops and Recusant Lords are
so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>p. 48</span>
numerous and prevalent, that they are able to
crosse and interrupt our best endeavours for reformation,
and by that meanes give advantage
to this malignant party to traduce our proceedings.
They infuse into the people, that we
meane to abolish all Church government, and
leave every man to his owne fancy for the service
and worship of God, absolving him of that
obedience which he owes under God unto his
Majesty whom wee know to be intrusted with
the ecclesiasticall law as well as with the temporall
to regulate all the members of the Church
of <i>England</i> by such rules of order and discipline
as are established by parliament which is his
great Councell, in all affaires both in Church
and State. We confesse our intention is and our
endeavours have been to reduce within bounds
that exorbitant power which the prelates have
assumed unto themselves so contrary both to the
Word of God, and to the Laws of the Land, to
which end wee past the Bill for the removing
them from their temporall power, and imployments,
that so the better they might with meekenesse
apply themselves to the discharge of their
functions, which Bill themselves opposed, and
were the principall instruments of crossing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>p. 49</span></p>

<p>And we do here declare, that it is farre from
our purpose or desire to let loose the golden
reynes of discipline, and government in the
Church, to leave private persons or particular
Congregations to take up what forme of divine
Service they please; for we hold it requisite
that their should be throughout the whole
Realme a conformity to that Order which the
Lawes enjoyne, according to the Word of
God: and we desire to unburthen the consciences
of men of needlesse and superstitious
ceremonies, suppresse innovations, and take
away the monuments of Idolatry. And the better
to effect the intended reformation we desire
there may be a generall Synod of the most
grave, pious, learned, and judicious Divines of
this Island, assisted with some from forraine
parts professing the same Religion with us,
who may consider of all things necessary for
the peace &amp; good government of the Church,
and represent the results of their consultations
unto the Parliament to be there allowed of
and confirmed, and receive the stamp of authority
thereby to finde passage and obedience
throughout the Kingdome. They have malitiously
charged us that wee intend to
destroy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>p. 50</span>
and discourage learning, whereas it is our chiefest
care and desire to advance it and to provide
a competent maintenance for conscionable
and preaching Ministers throughout the
Kingdome, which will be a great encouragement
to Schollers, and a certaine means whereby
the want, meanesse, and ignorance to which
a great part of the Clergy is now subject, will
be prevented. And wee intend likewise to reforme,
and purge the fountaines of learning
the two Universities, that the streames flowing
from thence may be cleere and pure, and an
honour and comfort to the whole Land. They
have strayned to blast our proceedings in Parliament
by wresting the interpretations of our
Orders from their genuine intention. They
tell the people that our medling with the
power of Episcopacy, hath caused sectaries and
conventicles, when idolatry and popish ceremonies
introduced in the Church by the command
of the Bishops have not onely debarred
the people from thence, but expelled them
from the Kingdome. Thus with <i>Eliah</i> we are
called by this malignant party the troublers of
the State, and still while we endeavour to reforme
their abuses, they make us the
authours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>p. 51</span>
of those mischiefes we study to prevent: for
the perfecting of the worke begun and removing
all future impediments, we conceave these
courses will be very effectuall, seeing the religion
of the Papists, hath such principals as doe
certainely tend to the destruction and extirpation
of all Protestants when they shall have
opportunity to effect it.</p>

<p>It is necessary in the first place to keep them
in such a condition, as that they may not be
able to do us any hurt, and for avoyding of such
connivence and favour as hath heretofore been
shewed unto them, That his Majesty be pleased
to grant a standing Commission to some
choice men named in Parliament, who may
take notice of their encrease, their counsels
and proceedings, and use all due meanes by
execution of the Lawes to prevent all mischievous
designes, against the peace and safety of
this Kingdome. That some good course be
taken to discover the counterfeit and false conformity
of Papists to the Church by colour
whereof persons very much disaffected to the
true religion have beene admitted into place
of greatest authority and trust in the Kingdome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>p. 52</span></p>

<p>For the better preservation of the Lawes
and liberties of the Kingdome, that all illegall
grievances and exactions be presented, and
punished at the Sessions, and Assizes: and that
Judges and Justices be very carefull to give this
in charge to the grand Jury, and both the
Sheriffe and Justices to be sworne to the due
execution of the petition of right and other
Lawes: That his Majesty be humbly petitioned
by both houses to employ such Counsellours,
Ambassadors, and other Ministers in mannaging
his businesse at home and abroad, as the
Parliament may have cause to confide in, without
which wee cannot give his Majesty such
supplies for support of his owne estate, nor
such assistance to the protestant party beyond
the Sea, as is desired. It may often fall out that
the Commons may have just cause to take
exceptions at some men for being Counsellors,
and yet not charge those men with crimes, for
there be grounds of diffidence which lie not
in proofe: there are others which though they
may be proved yet are not legally criminall, to
be a knowne favourer of papists, or to have
beene very forward in defending or countenancing
some great offenders questioned
in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>p. 53</span>
Parliament, or to speake contemptuously of
either Houses of Parliament, or Parliamentary
proceedings, or such as are factours or agents
for any forraine Prince of another Religion,
such are justly suspect to get Counsellors places
or any other of trust concerning publique
imployment for money: For all these and
divers others wee may have great reason to be
earnest with his Majesty not to put his great
affaires into such hands, though we may be unwilling
to proceed against them in any legall
way of charge or impeachment: that all Counsellors
of State may be sworn to observe those
Lawes which concerne the Subject in his libertie,
that they may likewise take an oath not
to receive or give reward or pension from any
forraine Prince, but such as they shall within
some reasonable time discover to the Lords of
his Majesties Councell: and although they
should wickedly forsweare themselves, yet it
may herein doe good to make them knowne
to be false and perjured to those who imploy
them, and thereby bring them into as little
credit with them as with us. That his Majesty
may have cause to be in love with good Counsel
and good men, by shewing him in an
humble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>p. 54</span>
and dutifull manner, how full of advantage it
would be to himselfe, to see his owne estate
setled in a plentifull condition to support his
honour, to see his people united in waies of
duty to him, and endeavours of the publique
good; to see happinesse, wealth, peace and
safety derived to his owne Kingdome, and procured
to his Allies by the influence of his owne
power and government. That all good courses
may be taken to unite the two Kingdomes of
<i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i> to be mutually ayding
and assisting of one another for the common
good of the Island, and honour of both. To
take away all differences amongst our selves
for matters indifferent in their owne nature
concerning Religion; and to unite our selves
against the common enemies which are the
better enabled by our divisions to destroy us
all, as they hope and have often endeavoured.
To labour by all offices of friendship to unite
the forrain Churches with us in the same cause,
and to seeke their liberty, safety, and prosperity,
as bound thereunto both by charity to
them, and by wisdome for our owne good. For
by this meanes our owne strength shall be encreased,
and by a mutuall concurrence to
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>p. 55</span>
same common end, we shall be enabled to procure
the good of the whole body of the Protestant
profession. If these things may be observed,
wee doubt not but God will crowne
this Parliament with such successe as shall be
the beginning, and foundation of more honour
and happinesse to his Majesty, then ever yet
was enjoyed by any of his Royall Predecessors.</p>
